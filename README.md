# Isle of dogs

Welcome to Isle of dogs, with its endless beaches, piles of tennis balls, and cotton candy sky.

# Bolmond Cockapoo Palace

Dive in the pool, chew on a sun lounger, or do some dog-watching in the hotel bar with a delicious mocktail. Enjoy a dinner prepared by top chefs before cuddling down in the fluffy duvets - perhaps with your human by your side?

("Bring human" is a feature offered for an additional fee)
